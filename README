Eclipse Web-based IDE using Google's GWT.

This work include Ian Bull's Hello World Example ported to GWT 1.7. It also
includes an Eclipse launcher that runs the example in an Eclipse workbench.

This is the start of the next phase of this project, building an IDE front-end
using GWT UI and RPC code that interacts with core Eclipse components that
we have today.
